# student-mananagement-system

This project is a simple web application which allows the user to perform CRUD operations on a student database.

The server part of the program is programmed using Spring Boot, while the front-end is done in Thymeleaf. For the styling of the HTML pages, Bootstrap is used to make the page more user friendly.

The server part's architecture is directly based on the Model-View-Controller architecture, with each of the components being separate packages in the code.

The models in this case are the student objects which are stored in the database.
The view components are represented by the html.-files, which are also called templates.
The controller is in this case the class which handles the incoming URL requests coming from the browser.
